# WIP
## Goal:
- vscode like builtin marketplace for neovim that finds plugins from nvim.sh

## Wishlist:
- cutomizability on:
    - curl options
    - searching techniques(nvim.sh api, grep, rg or potentially telescope)
- keybinds for:
    - copying the lua code needed to install the plugin
    - searching (maybe use vim apis to read from stdin)
    - popup to see the project README (mdcat for better readability)
- fetch project README
- autocmds to add plugins to a list so there's a seamless experience

## Can now:
- fetch the plugin list and parse it
- create the popup and the side view

## Does it work yet?
    - Not really
